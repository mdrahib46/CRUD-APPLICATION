# CRUD Flutter Application

This is a Flutter application that demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The app allows users to manage products, including adding new products, viewing a list of products, updating existing ones, and deleting them.

## Features
- View product list
- Add new product
- Update product details
- Delete product
- Fetch and interact with a RESTful API

## Screens
- **Product List Screen**: Displays a list of products and provides options to update or delete each product.
- **Add New Product Screen**: A form to add a new product.
- **Update Product Screen**: A form to update details of an existing product.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) installed
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/) SDK installed
- Internet connection (to interact with the REST API)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Project Structure

```plaintext
lib/
│
├── models/
│   └── product.dart              # Product model class
│
├── screens/
│   ├── productlist_screen.dart    # Product list screen
│   ├── add_new_product_screen.dart# Screen for adding a new product
│   └── update_product_screen.dart # Screen for updating product details
│
├── widgets/
│   └── product_item.dart          # Widget to display each product
│
├── app.dart                       # Main app file
└── main.dart                      # Entry point of the application
```

### API Endpoints

- **GET** `/api/v1/ReadProduct`: Fetches the list of products.
- **POST** `/api/v1/CreateProduct`: Adds a new product.
- **POST** `/api/v1/UpdateProduct/:id`: Updates an existing product by ID.
- **GET** `/api/v1/DeleteProduct/:id`: Deletes a product by ID.

### How it works

1. **Fetching Products**:
   - The product list is fetched from the API when the app starts.
   - The data is displayed in a list format using a `ListView` widget.
   
2. **Adding a Product**:
   - The user can navigate to the "Add New Product" screen via the FloatingActionButton.
   - A form is displayed where the user can enter product details.
   - The form data is sent to the API, and the product list is updated.

3. **Updating a Product**:
   - Each product in the list has an "Edit" button.
   - The user is redirected to an "Update Product" screen with pre-filled data.
   - The changes are sent to the API to update the product.

4. **Deleting a Product**:
   - Each product has a "Delete" button.
   - A confirmation dialog appears before deleting the product.
   - On confirmation, the product is deleted via the API, and the list is refreshed.

### Dependencies

- `http`: To perform API calls
- `flutter/material.dart`: Core Flutter framework for building the UI
- `dart:convert`: For handling JSON encoding and decoding

### Future Enhancements
- Add input validation for the forms.
- Implement pagination for the product list.
- Include image upload functionality instead of URL input for product images.
- Improve error handling and display proper messages for API errors.
